I can understand your concern for your child's wellbeing. While I'm not able to provide specific advice for special needs, JoveHeal does offer various healing programs that focus on emotional blocks and behavioral patterns. Programs like "The Healing Circle" or individual sessions may provide supportive environments for families dealing with challenges. I'd recommend reaching out to JoveHeal directly for tailored guidance. Would you like me to share how you can contact them?
