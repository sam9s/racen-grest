## Q20: Is this process like therapy, or more like coaching + energy healing + personal growth?

**Answer:**

JoveHeal's process is more aligned with coaching, energy healing, and personal growth rather than traditional therapy. The focus is on deep inner work, mindset shifts, and energetic healing to help participants break through barriers and create lasting change in their lives.

Coaching at JoveHeal involves personalized support to guide you in gaining clarity, aligning with your true potential, and evolving in various aspects of your life, whether that be career, relationships, or personal development. The integration of energy healing modalities, such as NLP and Theta Healing, complements this coaching approach, aiming to facilitate deeper transformations and shifts in mindset.

It's important to note that this process does not replace therapy or counseling, as it does not provide medical, psychological, or therapeutic advice. Instead, it offers a supportive environment for personal growth and healing.
